# NEAT_AI_With_Java
This is a project created for my Computer Science A class using Java to implement a NEAT algorithm and shoot down targets.

This uses the FXGL package to create a simple game in Java that involves shooting down targets.

I then created a NEAT algorithm in Java that allowed me to train a neural network on these targets.

I tried to implement the NEAT algorithm from scratch as I wanted to learn more about the mathematics and basics behind it rather than rely on any packages.
